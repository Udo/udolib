# ulib PHP

## What is it?

ulib is a small single-file library of convenience functions
without any external dependencies.

Feel free to contact me at udo.schroeter@gmail.com for
questions and comments.

## Why use it?

This is intended to be a small piece of living code to
make your life easier, it's not some big monolithic library.
Feel free to change things, add identifier prefixes, or 
implement namespacing as you see fit. Out of the box, ulib
comes with none of these assumptions and you should be
able to just include and start using it.
